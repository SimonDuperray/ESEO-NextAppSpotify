## The project idea

The data we deal with are provided by the Spotify API. We work with data about some Albums, Tracks or Artists.

Once all the data are fetched and restructured from the Spotify API, they will be stored into the Firebase database.

All the data are displayed on the homepage on the app. As a connected user we can add some tracks, artists or albums to a favorite collections.

In this collection we can rename a track, an album or an artist to recognize it easier for example.


If some features must be developer in the future, they will be developed here.
